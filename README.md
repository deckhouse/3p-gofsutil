# Notice

We need this fork because we want to disable root reservation for vsphere csi driver. If this issue https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/issues/2713 will be resolved, or upstream changes the logic and uses a different library, we can abandon this fork.

# Mount

A portable Go library for filesystem related operations such as mount,
format, etc.
